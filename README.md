# Write Tool for Aseprite
You can easily write texts in [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org/) instead of drawing every pixel of a character.



## Features
**Multiple Fonts** - Change the font you're using with the font selector (see [Supported Fonts](https://captainllamma.itch.io/write-tool/devlog/268014/supported-fonts) for all options)

**Color Picking** - You can now pick your favorite colors, instead of always getting black words

**Escape Characters** - Enable the "Allow escape characters" option to use escape characters in your text. The following escape characters are supported in this version: \n (new line), \t (tab), \\ (backslash).

**Alignment Options** - Choose the alignment of the text. The following choices can be made: Left, Center and Right.
